## Releases
* Every commit to _master_ branch will [deploy](.github/workflows/checks.yml) a new release to the _ALPHA_ channel in Google Play-Store. You can subscribe to this release channel by joining the [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/anysoftkeyboard-alpha-testers) group, and opt-in by visiting [this link](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.menny.android.anysoftkeyboard).
* Every Wednesday the latest _ALPHA_ will be [promoted](.github/workflows/deployment_promote.yml) to _BETA_. You can opt-in to this channel by visiting [this link](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.menny.android.anysoftkeyboard).
* Note about pre-release channels: every few months we will remove all the users in the groups. When that happens, you are required to re-subscribe to the group. This is done to ensure that the members in the groups are active.
* Once all requirements for a release were finished, a _STABLE_ release branch (in the format of `release-branch-vX.X-rX`) will be cut. Every commit to this branch will be automatically published to Google Play Store (_STABLE_ channel) and will roll-out users gradually.
