Coptic Language pack

This is a keyboard layout expansion pack for entering text
in Coptic, the last surviving descendent of the Ancient Egyptian
Language and a liturgical language of the Christian religious
tradition in Egypt.

The layout is based on the one from coptic-dictionary.org,
but condensed to fit all the letters on a phone keyboard.
Some double letters have been combined with singles.
That is, long-press on ⲡ for ⲯ, on ⲧ for ⲑ and ϯ, and so on.

This is an expansion language pack for AnySoftKeyboard.
Install AnySoftKeyboard first, and then select the Coptic keyboard
from AnySoftKeyboard's Settings -> Languages -> Keyboards menu.
