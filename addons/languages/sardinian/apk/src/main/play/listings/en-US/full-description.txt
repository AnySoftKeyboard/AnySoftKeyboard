Sardinian keyboard layout and dictionary of over 100,000 words.

Dictionary comes from a wordlist made for other open source projects. The source code is in another branch to the default.

This is an expansion language pack for AnySoftKeyboard.
Install AnySoftKeyboard first, and then select the Sardinian keyboard from AnySoftKeyboard's Settings -> Languages -> Keyboards menu.
