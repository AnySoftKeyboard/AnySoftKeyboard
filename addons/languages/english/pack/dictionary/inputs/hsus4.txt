            I hope you’ll use the enclosed name labels, and colorful pet stickers, designed especially for friends of animals.
            
            Your name -- and the name of The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) -- are very important to the well-being of all animals because together we can prevent suffering and save lives.
            
            I wish I could tell you that everyone is concerned about protecting earth’s animals -- dogs, cats, farm animals and wildlife. The sad truth is animal cruelty, abuse and neglect continues at an alarming rate across the nation and even in your own community.
            
            Every day of the year, The Humane Society of the United States receives reports about all kinds of animal cruelties, such as the horrors of the leghold trap; the use of dog and cat fur; needless or repetitive experiments on animals; and the abusive treatment of dogs and cats.
            
            Still others are less obvious but just as horrible; dogs fighting to the death for the benefit of blood thirsty gamblers; baby calves confined and malnourished to provide “milk-fed” veal for the gourmet; and the “accidental” drowning of porpoises in the nets of tuna fishermen. And almost 6,000,000 companion pets are put to death in shelters throughout America.
            
            What is even more shocking, is that more than 30 million animals die these cruel, painful deaths each year ... needless deaths that could have been stopped!
            
            And with so much animal cruelty and suffering going on, I’m sure you can understand why the work of The Humane Society of the United States is so vitally important and why we need the support of many other people, like you, to help us bring an end to animal suffering, abuse and neglect.
            
            Since 1954, our programs and activities have been aimed at stopping and eliminating all animal abuse and we continue to spend a great deal of time investigating animal cruelty cases and working with the courts to prosecute the guilty parties.
            
            We also work hard and lobby for better animal welfare laws at the local, state and federal government levels and we insist they enforce existing laws to prevent animal cruelty.
            
            Our primary goal, though, has always been to stop the cruel and inhumane treatment of animals before it happens, so we teach the public about the need to protect all animals from suffering, abuse and exploitation.
            
            But while our programs and activities have been successful in reducing animal cruelty, we are constantly faced with new problems of animal suffering which need immediate attention and drain our resources.
            It’s a difficult problem, because we have to fight the well-financed and powerful agri-business and research industries, but we do our best to protect the animals.
            
            Right now, the problems are mounting and we need all the help we can get to stop animal cruelty.
            
            And that’s where you can help. You can be a lifesaving “friend” to all animals by telling friends and family about the important work of The HSUS and asking them to become vigilant in safe-guarding the lives of ALL animals.
            
            Today, we are placing special emphasis on pet adoption. I hope you will visit your local animal shelter and consider adopting a dog or cat into your home. It’s a wonderful way to enjoy their companionship and save the life of a loving animal, too.
            
            I also hope you will give a big boost to our work to protect all animals by sending a generous tax-deductible donation today. Your gift of at least $5 or $10 or even $15, will help The HSUS save millions of animals.
            
            I know you care deeply for the well-being of all animals. Please help us carry this message to others so that animal cruelty and abuse can be eliminated.
            
            Sincerely,
            
            
            President
            
            P.S. We are totally committed to putting an end to all forms of animal cruelty and neglect. But your help of $5 or $10 or even $15 is absolutely needed today. Please take this moment to be as generous as possible to send your best gift today, and don’t forget to use your free colorful pet stickers and name labels enclosed. Thanks in advance.
