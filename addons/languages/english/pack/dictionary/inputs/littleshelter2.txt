            Dear Ms. LastName
            
            These are the pawprints of a homeless animal; an abandoned animal, shivering with fear, with no place to call home. Where will these pawprints lead?
            With your help they can lead to Little Shelter’s good food, medical attention and a warm place to sleep for homeless and frightened animals. And then we’ll work to find loving homes for them
            
            You might be wondering how much to send. Our average gift is about $21. If you could give $20 or more, I can promise we’ll use your money to help animals start new, happier lives.
            At this wonderful time of the year, when people are celebrating,
            (Over, please)
            
            “The only no-kill shelter that’s there when you need us” Little Shelter is crowded with animals waiting for homes. It hurts us especially now to see a scrawny dog . . . a wet, starving kitten . homeless animals that would otherwise die if Little Shelter didn’t provide the care, treatment and love these animals need. If you could see them, I know you would want to help.
            Your reward will be the wag of a tail you’ll never see, the soft purr you’ll never hear -- and the warm joy of knowing you were there to help when you were needed.
            Happy Holidays from all of us!
            
            
            Sincerely,
            
            
            Maryann Chernovsky
            President
            
            P.S. Please accept the enclosed 2001 calendar and gift tags as a special greeting from our animal friends and Little Shelter.
