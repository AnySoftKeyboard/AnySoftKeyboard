    "body": "I have not read through all the sources of ASK, but my impression is that many elements which combine into a keyboard layout (such as `The Top Row`) are described by “just an XML file” which is read and processed *at run-time*.  So why not make these editable at run-time?!\n\n**If so:**\n\nSuppose that \n* in the dialogue for choosing `The Top Row` there appear 10 other choices: “Custom 1”, …, “Custom 10”.  \n* Initially, these extra choices are “empty”.\n* When long-pressing on a “usual, not-`Custom`” variant of the choice of top row (or maybe in the `⋮`-menu when it is selected) there is a choice “go to the XML of this variant”.  (Just a link to the GitHub page.)\n* Additionally, on these “new” `Custom N` choices, there is a similar choice to `Edit the XML` — which just shows a standard multiline text-entry editor.   (It is OK if a restart is required after editing — but I do not see why this may be so…)\n\nThese 3 enhancement seem to be easy to implement — but I think this may be a great first step to make the layout editable.  For example, later one may \n* Write (simple!) scripts processing other (easier-to-write) formats into XML-understood-by-ASK; \n* Yet later, one may enable plug-ins which allow these other formats processed at the run-time (by ``Import another format` — in addition to `Edit the XML`).",

The second problem is that most of the light-themes either do not show the hints at all (at least not the way I can see) — or show them with such a low contrast that I have been missing this display until I tried to “pay special attention”.  The only exception among standard themes is the *Plain Light Theme*.\n\n**Expected behavior:** if a theme supports hints, they should be shown with sufficient contrast (or with an outline in a contrasting color).

    "body": "### Feature idea\n\n**Related optimization problem and use case**\nThis Feature Request aims to *optimize writing speed of correct written words*. It's adressing fast typers.\n\n*Fast typing* is hereby defined by >= ~200 keys per minute (you can test e.g. [here](https://www.speedtypingonline.com/typing-test)). It can be achived by e.g. using both thumbs (which here may be assumed).\n\n**Key observations for the problem**\n*1. The optimal gazing point while typing is imo in the ~middle of the keyboard.*\nThis way the periphal gaze can catch all the keys on the keyboard best. This increases the typing precision.\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5eade967-edc5-4982-98d6-8dcb697df81a\" width=75><sub></sub></p>\n\n\n\n</br>\n\nYou see the gaze is a bit higher than middle, this may be good because the thumbs might be blocking the view on the lower position for the overlay (but that I'm currently not sure about, because the thumbs are normally moving).\n\n*2. The high feedback loop with suggested word forecasting (while typing) probably isn't useful for most fast typers.* \nFast typers are so fast that the cost of viewing the possible suggestion-completions (and recognizing them) is higher than just typing the word to end fast.\n\n*3. Still: A low-cognitive-profile feedback of what is typed, is still useful for improving accuracy of key-typing*\nSeeing which letters are currently hit is probably still interesting for improving key-typing accuracy. It has a low-cognitive-profile because that is currently, what was mentally adressed anyway and should typically be exspected result (except when a wrong key was hit). Also it can be showed where the gaze already is in place.\n\n*4. Still: To see a word was written wrongly (and also correct it) is still useful, especially if the word was completley written.*\nThis can be done by showing the current/last word on the gazing place. Also, if auto-correction is on (probably recommendable), the words should came out as wanted (because it was manually typed) in most cases if it wasn't corrected. And if it was corrected by the auto-correction it can be shown in place and also make the phone vibrate. This should appear when the **spacebar was hit, showing the current wordwriting is finished** .\n\n**Solution**\nOn the gazing position (~middle keyboard) an overlay can be shown, which shows the current word.\n- The last letter of the word always stands in the same place (new key types push the \"old\" letters to the left, so the word grows to the left).\n- When the space-key is pressed and it wasn't autocorrected, it still shows the same word (maybe only for at most 3 seconds unitl the overlay hides). If a key for a new key is pressed and a new word begins, the overlay shows the first word letter (begins anew).\n- When the space-key is pressed and it was autocorrected, the overlay shows the autocorrected word on them same position (and maybe the phone vibrates in low volume). The written word is shown above crossed out.\n  - (If the auto-correction was right relevant) Same behavior as above with 3 seconds (or so) until the overlay hides, or alternativly a new word was begon.\n  - If the auto-correction was wrong. Click/swype for showing all possible other corrections including the original writing. Or delete the last single letters or delete the whole word.\n\nI think it's best to see what I mean in an animated GIF, so I made one (which took longer to make than i exspected, but hopefully it has some value), click to make it bigger: \n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/544cdf1b-8b98-487d-8e07-f780f74c8a9c\" width=125></p> \n\n<p align=\"center\">(The overlay is transparent)</p>\n\nThe last written letter could be emphasized in some way, but such things are details.\n\nSmall adjustment: It would be good if there would be a visual emphasis on the current letter, (which is the watch anchor / gaze anchor / focal point) and typing is using peripheral vision. E.g. by a highlighting with an additional background rectangle.\n\nE.g. like this:\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b5c8ac0-151a-4c75-a791-ea564f504c83\" width=125></p> \n\n\n(the rectangle isn't perfect matching the letter and it's color could be better, but you see, what i mean)",

On first run of a fresh app, it gets stuck on \"change default keyboard...\" window and I can only skip the process. Later, when I open the keyboard app, it still shows that \"AnySoft Keyboard is not fully configured\" warning (it is, and it is the default).\nThat's not something critical, but mildly annoying.\n\nSecond problem: on English Compact layout, you can get international characters, but ONLY for first character in a key (so for \"AS\" key it's only A and variations, for \"BN\" it's only B, for \"UI\" it's only U). I'm Polish and it would be great to have a full set of characters - 2 are missing: Ś and Ń. Is it possible to either fix the EN Compact layout so it has a full set of diacritics or add a Polish Compact layout?\n\nThis layout is a lifesaver for me (and other people with big fingers too, I'm sure :D) as I can't type on a normal QWERTY layout without a ton of typos. No other application offers that.\n\nIssues tested on:\n- Samsung A53, Android 16, OneUI 8\n- Samsung Galaxy Xcover 7, Android 16, One UI 8\n- Motorola Moto e7 plus, LineageOS 22.2 (Android 15)",
