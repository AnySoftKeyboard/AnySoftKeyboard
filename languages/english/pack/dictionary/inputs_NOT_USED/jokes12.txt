Offbeat Joke

A musician who joined an orchestra on a cruise ship was having a terrible time keeping time with the rest of the band.
Finally, the band leader said, "Look, either you learn to keep time or I'll throw you overboard. It's up to you, sync or swim."
The Human Race Is Doomed
In case you needed further proof that the Human Race is doomed through stupidity, here are some actual label instructions on consumer products;

Guess the sex of the originator of this one!! 
Scholars have long debated the exact ethnicity and nationality of Jesus. 
Recently, at a theological meeting in Rome, scholars had a heated debate on this subject. 
One by one, they offered their evidence... 
THREE PROOFS THAT JESUS WAS MEXICAN 
1. His first name was Jesus 
2. He was bilingual 
3. He was always being harassed by the authorities
 
But then there were equally good arguments that...
JESUS WAS BLACK 
1. He called everybody "brother" 
2. He liked Gospel 
3. He couldn't get a fair trial 

Then there were equally good arguments that...
JESUS WAS JEWISH 
1. He went into His Father's business 
2. He lived at home until he was 33 
3. He was sure his Mother was a virgin, and his Mother was sure he was 
God 

Then there were equally good arguments that... 
JESUS WAS ITALIAN 
1. He talked with his hands 
2. He had wine with every meal 
3. He used olive oil
 
Then there were equally good arguments that... 
JESUS WAS A CALIFORNIAN 
1. He never cut his hair 
2. He walked around barefoot 
3. He started a new religion
 
Then there were equally good arguments that... 
JESUS WAS IRISH 
1. He never got married 
2. He was always telling stories 
3. He loved green pastures 

But perhaps the most compelling evidence ... 
THREE PROOFS THAT JESUS WAS A WOMAN ... 
1. He had to feed a crowd at a moment's notice when there was no food 
2. He kept trying to get the message across to a bunch of men who JUST DIDN'T GET IT. 
3. Even when He was dead, He had to get up because there was more work for him to do
