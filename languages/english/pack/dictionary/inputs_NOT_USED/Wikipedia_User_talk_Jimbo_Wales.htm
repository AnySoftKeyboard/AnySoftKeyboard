<p><span class="template-ping">@<a href="/wiki/User:Jimbo" title="User:Jimbo" class="mw-redirect">Jimbo</a>:</span>, I initiated contact with our Prime Minister's office today after seeing <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2016/04/12/police-foil-suicide-pact-of-13-youngsters-in-struggling-attawapiskat.html">this</a> most recent awful example of epidemic despondency among our First Nations youth. I am thinking that if they could become engaged as Wikipedia editors that could give their lives more meaning and fun. They might also want to expand the encyclopedia's content concerning the 634 tribes/bands. I am sure lots of the youth in more isolated bands/locations do not have personal internet access and I am going to suggest that some of the enormous amount of money our new Liberal government just budgeted for First Nations be used to provide I-phones to each of the youth and establish high speed access in all locations. Even if they just use them for games, Facebook, and communicating with people outside of Canada, it could help relieve the boredom and absence of a future that many are living with. Ideally, some will want to get engaged as active editors. I do not know how far I will get with this, but would it be ok if I suggested to someone in <a href="/wiki/Justin_Trudeau" title="Justin Trudeau">Justin Trudeau</a>'s office that they could contact you to discuss wiki possibilities for these youth? <a href="/wiki/User:Nocturnalnow" title="User:Nocturnalnow">Nocturnalnow</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Nocturnalnow" title="User talk:Nocturnalnow">talk</a>) 02:58, 13 April 2016 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, that would be fine. I was just in Canada yesterday and looked into how our recognized regional language versions of Wikipedia are doing - the answer is that there are only a few small projects. I'm sure that lack of Internet access is a major reason for that. If this is an issue that you'd like to take up further, and I apologize for not knowing how involved you've been with it in the past, there are a lot of people in chapters around the world who could likely advise on what has worked (or not worked) in their areas to assist with connectivity and/or participation in smaller or more economically depressed areas.--<a href="/wiki/User:Jimbo_Wales" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Jimbo_Wales#top" title="User talk:Jimbo Wales">talk</a>) 12:10, 13 April 2016 (UTC)

<dd>Update: The communication between the PM's office and M.P.'s office and myself is underway concerning internet access and providing iPhones to the people in the most vulnerable demographic. I am still working on nailing down a primary contact person in the P.M.'s office. I will also be contacting our Canada, Argentina and Finland chapters regarding outreach.

<dd>Suicide is a major issue for young men all over the world. This does look like a very positive idea for allowing rapid and inexpensive engagement. I am quite ignorant of the variety of phones available, but was under the impression that iAnything was the most expensive. It might also be worth noting that with a wi-fi signal, all the Internet services can be accessed on a mobile. This may be a considerably more cost-effective solution for some areas, compared with erecting masts and towers.

Right now I have a vision, subject to change should you having different ideas, of 1 or more of us using email and/or telephone and or Skype to communicate directly with individuals, groups, and local teachers promoting and illustrating how much fun and education the youth can have through Wiki editing.

<p>Jimmy,</p>
<p>This is my 4th and "final" posting on this page about my series of article quality investigations.</p>
<p>Using a sample of 80 articles, quality as measured by modified <a class="external text" href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Objective_Revision_Evaluation_Service">ORES scores</a> for previously created Wikipedia articles increases slowly, on average increasing only at a rate of 1 point (e.g. from stub to start) per 20 years. The tendency to increase is consistent however and holds for</p>
<ul>
<li>articles in different categories</li>
<li>articles started in different years, and</li>
<li>articles in all page view quartiles.</li>
</ul>
<p>The tendency for the quality of newly created articles to be better than the quality of the previous year's newly created articles is less consistent, but more than twice as large as the tendency for previously created articles to increase.</p>

<p>I say this is my final posting here, as I think all the easily examined questions that interested me on article quality are now answered (at least to my satisfaction) and any other questions that I have will be much harder to address. However, there is a nice 1000 random article data set now that other folks can use to help answer their own questions. See <a href="/wiki/User:Smallbones/1000_random" title="User:Smallbones/1000 random">User:Smallbones/1000 random</a>. If anybody has any questions on how this data set might be used, or even if you want my help in gathering a bit more data, please just ask.</p>
<p>There's a research project listing over at meta that I might post to, but my feeling is that I'd have to up my game quite a bit to make it worthwhile, e.g. larger data sets and actual significance testing! If anybody here is familiar with bots and APIs and wants to help me out, please let me know.

<dd>I don't answer questions from the usual banned editor - only from people who want to know the answer to their questions. The best place for you (EllenCT) to start would be to look at <a class="external text" href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Objective_Revision_Evaluation_Service">ORES scores</a>. It's a machine learning project and has all the usual advantages and disadvantages. The new GA decisions would be an interesting study and it would take a fair amount of time. One of the usual disadvantages of machine learning is that a computer will be looking at a fairly limited number of factors, so that "fine points" won;t be considered. One of the usual advantages is that computers are consistent but humans can be all over the place, e.g. give an article to 3 people it's possible that they'd come up with three different ratings. So I think I'd need a way of determining whether the computer or the human rater was more likely wrong when they disagree on the GA rating. Any ideas on how to do that? <a href="/wiki/User:Smallbones" title="User:Smallbones">Smallbones</a><sub>(<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Smallbones" title="User talk:Smallbones"><font color="#CC6600">smalltalk</font></a>)</sub> 16:01, 15 April 2016 (UTC)

<dd>It would be interesting to hear more about the degree of confidence that the ORES edit quality model and article quality model bear out appropriately when actually assessed by intelligence experts. Was there any verification or confirmation that having people like "Epicgenius", "MrX", "Coretheapple", and "ONUnicorn" <i>training</i> a bot to understand 20,000 randomly sampled edits was a rigorous methodology? Looking at the Talk page of the ORES training project, it looks like there was a lot of confusion at first about what constitutes "damage" to the encyclopedia. In one case, the volunteers who trained the model were told, "Do not worry too much about 'making the wrong decision' - just stick to your best judgement even if it appears to be 'too close to call'." That's not a strong system, if it's based on personal discretion and not worrying too much. - <a href="/wiki/User:Frugal_fisherman" title="User:Frugal fisherman">Frugal fisherman</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Frugal_fisherman" title="User talk:Frugal fisherman">talk</a>) 03:35, 16 April 2016 (UTC)

<dd>I encourage anybody with the time to play around with the ORES scores to see how they work.
<ul>
<li>1st define a sample you want to use. In the GA case I'd suggest the most recent 50 or 100 decisions made at GA</li>
<li>2nd go to <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ores.wmflabs.org/v2/scores/enwiki/wp10/#####">https://ores.wmflabs.org/v2/scores/enwiki/wp10/#####</a> and replace the ##### with the permanent ID for the version of the article you want to use (probably the permid on the date of the decision)</li>
<li>record whether the final GA decision was positive or negative for each article, and what the predicted ORES value was for the article on that date. You'll end up with a 2x2 table something like
<ul>
<li>(ORES GA, Human not GA) (ORES GA, Human GA)</li>
<li>(ORES not GA, Human not GA) (ORES not GA, Human GA)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>and this will be the data that you'd use for most tests</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>The real question I have is what you want to test, or how you'd interpret the table. I would expect that the cells where the 2 methods agree would be more numerous than the cells where they disagree, but there certainly will be items in the cells where they disagree. What would convince you that there is a reasonable match between the methods?</li>
<li>based on your previous question about correlograms I'm guessing that we are using different terminology or that you need to brush up on your stats. I'll suggest that you take some time with somebody you know who knows stats to decide what exactly you want to test. You'll probably end up using a non-parametric correlation coefficient like Kendall's tau or maybe even a Chi-squared test, but it really depends what you're trying to test. <a href="/wiki/User:Smallbones" title="User:Smallbones">Smallbones</a><sub>(<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Smallbones" title="User talk:Smallbones"><font color="#CC6600">smalltalk</font></a>)</sub> 17:16, 16 April 2016 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Look at the 7th line "prediction":"C" - take that as ORES predicts it fails GA. The "prediction" is based on the probabilities (you used the GA one) which all add to 1. It just picks the class with the highest probability.</dd>

I thinks ORES is his baby, I'm just a user of that service, but have used it enough to say that I have basic confidence in its predictions. Collecting data by hand does have its advantages: i see the article versions rated and most often agree with the rating prediction if I skim through the articles. But other than that and the work I've presented on this page I haven't tested the accuracy of the service.</p>
<p>That said the test stats check you link to, I believe are from training data. There's more training data than I thought would have been available, so maybe they did get this from "the wild" of actual Wikipedia ratings on the rating dates. I would have thought that would be real hard to do, rather than have trainers rate the articles. The training data should be a closer match than newly generated "wild" data, but it looks very impressive. I too am confused though - do the columns or the rows show the actual or the predictions? Once you know that you can summarize the table into a 2x2 table and you can use the Matthews correlation, or you can use a different non-parametric correlation coefficient for the current table. Though with so much data and the spread of the data over 6 classes, just about any correlation coefficient will work "pretty good". <a href="/wiki/User:Smallbones" title="User:Smallbones">Smallbones</a><sub>(<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Smallbones" title="User talk:Smallbones"><font color="#CC6600">smalltalk</font></a>)</sub> 14:53, 19 April 2016 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So. is that showing that the later editors bring more articles to quality standards?

<dl>
<dd>Actually, it's might be more the other way around - that the improvements are pretty slow in coming (though they do obviously come sooner or later for most articles) and that the original article quality is the most important factor in determining article quality - say 2 years after the article was created.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But first, I have to say that I've gone to some lengths not to over-interpret what I've done here. Have you noticed that many folks (especially on this page, it seems) like to go beyond the straight facts and try to draw conclusions that are just not there yet? Let me give my overall interpretation of what I've learned by doing all 4 investigations I've presented on this page. It's basic observation at this point, not full scale statistical research with competing hypotheses tested. Warning - these are just my interpretations or opinions, caveat lector.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>There are a lot of pretty poor articles on Wikipedia. Using the ratings from editors about 65% are rated stubs or are unassessed. Most of the rest are rated "start". But this doesn't mean much because almost all the ratings are out of date. We need a method that we can use to rate articles in a consistent and timely manner. ORES seems to do this pretty well.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think most active editors and most readers tend to ignore the low quality articles, so overall people have a pretty distorted view of Wikipedia's quality.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>There is a type of article I call "forgotten sub-stubs" - probably something over 500,000 of them. The 20% of articles with the lowest page views (that is the 1,000,000 least viewed articles) get in total less than 1% of all page views. Most of these articles are substubs or stubs, they are much worse in quality than those with higher page views (see graph above, on the right). IMHO many but not all of these forgotten substubs could be deleted to improve the quality of the encyclopedia.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I came up with a method to put articles into mutually exclusive categories. Biographies, Culture and Arts, and to a lesser extent Geography dominate our articles, and this basic breakdown has been pretty much stable since the start of the encyclopedia. Quality does differ across categories, especially for articles on Geography (especially for geo articles on the Eastern Hemisphere). Other than that there don't seem to be huge differences in quality or quality improvement across categories, but this area could use more work.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Biographies on women seem to have a lower starting quality than bios on men, and the quality improvement for women's bios is somewhat lower. I interpret that as caused by a lack of source material.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Articles that have been marked Vital by editors tend to have been started very early (i.e. 2001-2002). They started at fairly high quality and improved rapidly. A small matching sample of non-vital articles started at lower quality an improved slowly (0.10 point per year on average), until they reached start quality, when they improved three times as quickly (0.30 points per year). The determinants of the rate of quality improvement obviously needs more work. Compare these results to the 0.05 points per year rate in the graphs above, using a larger sample.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Quality improvement is pretty slow for articles that have been previously created, but at least it is consistently positive across article categories, page view categories, article age, and year of creation. The improvement in the quality of newly created articles for one year compared to the quality of newly created articles for the previous year, seems to be much larger than for the previously created articles, but is not consistent over time.</dd>
<dd>That last paragraph is the most direct answer to <a href="/wiki/User:AnonNep" title="User:AnonNep">AnonNep</a>'s question. But please view that answer in context - lots of other stuf is going on, and lots more work needs to be done to understand the dynamics.</dd>

Oh, wait: it's the same reason that most scientists in Australia now no-platform antivaxers. Kohs' claim that he was banned for challenging policy is self-serving bullshit. He was banned for abusing a volunteer-run, charity-funded project by selling articles. There is pretty strong community consensus against that. That consensus has strengthened over time, if anything, to the point that CorporateM, who IMO was doing it right in as much as it can be done right, was eventually stopped.

<dd>JzG, you say that Kohs' "first thought" when he saw Wikipedia was "how can I make money from this?" Do you have some explanation for the fact that he seems to have discovered editing Wikipedia <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Avia&amp;oldid=12575855">in March 2005</a>, but didn't issue any communication to the outside world about a paid editing service until May 2006, when he registered "Mywikibiz" as <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.corporations.pa.gov/Search/CorpSearch">a Pennsylvania entity</a>? It appears to me that he had logged about 540 edits to Wikipedia prior to registering his business name with the state. Are you suggesting, JzG, that some or most of these edits were not voluntarily offered? Regardless, how do you <i>know</i> what his first thoughts were when he saw Wikipedia? Is his reaction documented somewhere reliable, or are you merely spouting opinion and positioning it (repeatedly here, now) as a "fact" that we must believe. Thus far, I'm seeing a lot of guilty-looking people scurrying around about why we shouldn't trust a multi-Emmy-winning investigative journalist, when "our side" elected repeatedly not to present its side of the story, instead relying on some friendly librarian to defend Wikipedia for how handy its reference sources are.

Greg Kohs invented paid Wikipedia editing, attempted to negotiate a "best practices" program, got banned off for his trouble, and — unintended consequences alert — has been engaged in a decade-long crusade against WP as a result of his mistreatment. He doesn't "pay other people" to edit WP, he is a Wikipedia editor himself, generally in a paid capacity, I presume. He is also a consultant for those who want to do (COI) editing of Wikipedia without running afoul of general site practice. He's not a demon, only someone who saw and attempted to commercialize the edit-for-pay industry ahead of the curve. If he didn't invent it, somebody else would have. Kohs remains a paid editor of WP and the fact is that his comparatively few paid jobs (he himself provided his small potatoes dollar volume as a paid editor on this page within the past year) are rarely if ever deleted because he follows basic site rules (if not the TOS, which he regards as suicidal given the inevitability of retaliatory deletions by anti-paid editing extremists).

Attkisson did get at least one minor point wrong – the editor who reverted his <a href="/wiki/Morgellons" title="Morgellons">Morgellons</a> edits isn't an administrator. But they didn't elaborate on the rationale for reverting his cited addition. <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources_(medicine)#Searching_for_sources" title="Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources (medicine)">Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources (medicine) § Searching for sources</a> says that "PubMed is an excellent starting point for locating peer-reviewed medical literature reviews". I don't understand why <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4328066/">this</a> is "not reliable". <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/morgellons-disease/art-20044996">Mayo Clinic</a> says there is uncertainty, and further study is needed. But Wikipedia, rather than stating that it's a controversial topic where there are two polarized views, states just the "delusional belief" view as if it's a settled fact: <span class="inline-quote-talk" style="font-family: Georgia, 'DejaVu Serif', serif; color: #008560;">Although it has been suggested by Morgellons advocacy websites that Morgellons is related to an infectious disease, such as a <a href="/wiki/Tick-borne_disease" title="Tick-borne disease">tick-borne disease</a> or from plants, these claims have not been substantiated by available evidence or corroborated by physicians independent of these advocacy websites.</span> Attkisson also interviewed a research expert who was positive about Wikipedia, and a guy who was fired by his employer, apparently for unauthorized editing while on the job, for which he was outed by the WMF. <a href="/wiki/User:Wbm1058" title="User:Wbm1058">wbm1058</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Wbm1058" title="User talk:Wbm1058">talk</a>) 04:20, 18 April 2016 (UTC)

<dd>You could start with the conflicts of interest: "MJM, PJM and RBS serve without compensation on the scientific advisory panel of the Charles E. Holman Morgellons Disease Foundation." That's a foundation dedicated to proving that Morgellons exists, classic <a href="/wiki/Pathological_science" title="Pathological science">pathological science</a>. The CDC mounted an extensive investigation into Morgellons and found no evidence that it is a distinct disease. It is always self-diagnosed so it is inevitable that those who believe they have it will actually have a variety of conditions, but the most common is delusional parasitosis, according to sources. Wikipedia is a reality-based encyclopaedia, and Morgellons is not a reality-based diagnosis. <b><a href="/wiki/User_talk:JzG" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="/wiki/User:JzG/help" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 08:12, 18 April 2016 (UTC)

<dd>So the opinion that "delusional parasitosis" is the cause results in patients typically getting prescriptions for one of several antipsychotic drugs. Are you sure that those promoting this POV don't have a financial interest in the antipsychotic drug industry? How can they prove that it's all delusional? Are there microscopic fibers under the skin or not? Surely there would be some imaging techniques that could find the fibers if they were there. I'm skeptical. <a href="/wiki/University_of_New_Haven" title="University of New Haven">University of New Haven</a> is <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.newhaven.edu/4486/academic-programs/graduate-programs/cellular-molecular-biology/GSS-spring-2013/morgellons-disease.pdf">supporting Morgellons disease research</a>, and they don't seem like a "fringe university".

<dd>'Delusional parasitosis' is not a 'cause' of Morgallons any more than any other mental illness is. The 'diagnosis' (and lets get this right, this is a diagnosis by medical professions both psychiatric and otherwise) is not that DP causes Morgallons, its that people who tell themselves they have Morgallons actually have DP, some other mental illness, or a skin condition. University's will research literally anything anyone wants to fund them with. Even respectable ones. It is unsurprising that one is researching a disease that has been found repeatedly to not be a legitimate condition. When looking for evidence, its either threads from clothing, self-inflicted lesions, or another actual skin issue. It is unsurprising a lyme disease specialist is looking at it, I suspect their results will end up 'Oh look, its lyme disease'. <a href="/wiki/User:Only_in_death" title="User:Only in death">Only in death does duty end</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Only_in_death" title="User talk:Only in death">talk</a>) 16:35, 18 April 2016 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The paid editing aspect is disclosed conspicuously, multiple times in the segment, so it is hardly treated as irrelevant. That in itself does not make the criticism invalid.

<p>Dear Mr. Wales, I want to thank you for expressing the opinion that has been documented in the included photo. I only wish that various Wikipedias would follow such policy.</p>
<p>Recently I decided to return to actively participate in a Wikipedia (I will not name the language) after a long break, as a sort of therapeutic thing to do. Unfortunately, it turned out that the toxicity there has spread very widely.</p>
<p>In that Wikipedia, there is a rule that has been written in such a way that it is open for interpretation. For some reason, I was singled out by some people who interpreted the rule in the strictest possible way, and I was reprimanded for adhering to a completely valid interpretation of that rule, while others who have been interpreting the rule in a similar way as I did, had been allowed to follow that interpretation for a long time, possibly even for several years.</p>
<p>In the discussion that followed, I was mocked, ridiculed and derided by several users, including more than one admin. Whatever I said, and whatever I tried to offer as a solution was only met with belittlement, mocking and bullying.</p>
<p>So, it turned out that the Wikipedia in question has turned so toxic that there are toxic members even among the admins. Thus my self-prescribed therapy ended up very badly, leaving me feeling worse than I was before. So I decided that rather than stay there, I would not participate, or offer <i>pro bono</i> my professional skills as a translator and writer/editor to a Wikipedia where the atmosphere was so toxic, and where I was singled out to be belittled, mocked and bullied.</p>
<p>Even though English is not my native language, I have professional knowledge of English. So I decided that I would take a look and see if the atmosphere here in English Wikipedia wouldn't be so toxic, and if my participation would be appreciated here.</p>

Apparently the Finnish Wikipedia requires people make their signatures "include the plain form of their username", and she was being called out for putting "Ylva" in front, which she said "includes" it... pretty picayune, really. I remember in the past calling for a rule like that here, at least for administrators, because <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:JzG&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:JzG (page does not exist)">User:JzG</a> was signing admin posts as "Guy" and I feared the new users he was warning didn't understand how to contact him.

<dd>That might work, but of course if people really want to complain, they can complain about anything. I'm guessing that Jimmy doesn't read Finnish, so it could be awfully difficult for him to intervene on the Finnish Wikipedia matter.</dd>
<dd>So what can we do for Ylva? I'll suggest making her welcome here and suggest things that she might work on here. One thing that has kinda bothered me is that we have a translation effort on now. That's fine as far as it goes - but it mainly seems to go one way, e.g. translate English articles into Finnish, Estonian, Latvian, Bulgarian etc. Since Ylva has such beautiful English, I'll suggest that she translate Finnish articles into English. Bulgarians, Latvian, and maybe even Estonians might find it easier to then translate those Finnish-origin articles into their own languages. (I'm guessing not too many Bulgarians read Finnish compared to the number who read English). Of course there are likely other things that Ylva might want to work on, so other suggestions are welcome. Welcome, Ylva!</dd>

<dd><span class="template-ping">@<a href="/wiki/User:Smallbones" title="User:Smallbones">Smallbones</a>:</span> The problem with saying "they can complain about anything" is that it dismisses the opinions of other editors, which isn't properly collaborative. There actually <i>is</i> a policy there, and there's a discussion up on those pages now, and if she can make a small concession to end things on a positive note, that's the best thing to do. If we don't want to become the "toxic users" everybody complains about, we all have to look carefully for what concessions we would make freely, what compromises we would make grudgingly, and what injustices we would denounce but not let stop us completely from productive participations. The lifespan of this or any project is finite; its errors accumulate and weigh it down. The question is, as in life, can we do something productive with it during that lifespan? I would suggest this name issue is something that can be resolved reasonably. <a href="/wiki/User:Wnt" title="User:Wnt">Wnt</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Wnt" title="User talk:Wnt">talk</a>) 21:30, 17 April 2016 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you for your constructive suggestion in your earlier comment, and for welcoming me here. Since I'm a professional translator, with experience of not only translating from English into Finnish, but also from Finnish into English, translating articles from Finnish into English could very easily be one of the ways in which I could contribute. I'd just need to know which articles are in the need of translation, and get a couple of pointers to the appropriate help pages dealing with the conventions here in English Wikipedia when translating an article from another language, e.g. should it be marked as a translated article with some kind of template or classification, and other similar matters dealing with the procedures considered necessary when creating pages, and linking them to other language variants. After all, I'm almost certain that translating pages from Finnish would in the vast majority of cases require performing all those things. As I'm pretty computer savvy, having worked also in the IT field, I wouldn't be needing too much guidance, as long as I have pointers to the help pages dealing with the necessary matters. Naturally I'm interested in contributing also in other ways, but if there's need for translation from Finnish into English, I could easily start with that. —<a href="/wiki/User:Carennah" title="User:Carennah">Ylva Carennah</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Carennah" title="User talk:Carennah">talk</a>) 22:53, 17 April 2016 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Those are articles that have already been started in English. You might want to start from the other side - look at the Finnish articles that especially interest you (perhaps e.g. in the categories of Finnish women, art museums, artists, composers, writers, historic monuments) and see if there are English language articles (see other languages in the left hand column) and create complete new articles. In some areas, like Finnish cities and towns I'm sure the Finnish article is better than the English language article, so you can make additions to them. If you have translation work coming up, say related to hydroelectrical power, you might want to warm up by translating related Finnish articles into English.</dd>
<dd>I'd guess our rules are pretty similar to the Finnish Wikipedia's (hopefully not too similar!). We might be pretty picky about footnotes and citations. Finnish-language references are certainly allowed, but the majority of our readers will be more comfortable if there is an English-language ref to complement those refs. I think there is usually a one line acknowledgement at the bottom of the article, maybe</dd>

<p>I read today in a recent <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.iii.co.uk/research/LSE:TPOP/news/item/1924049">financial report</a>, "TPO is delighted to announce that it has signed an exclusive agreement with one of the most experienced super recruiters in the People's Republic of China to supply TPO SIM cards to students coming from the PRC to study at colleges in the US." No wonder we saw <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/263112-nonprofits-want-foreigners-to-boycott-chinese-internet-summit">Jimbo go to China in December 2015, despite passionate calls for him to boycott the conference</a>. This note will get censored quickly, I'm sure, on the "free, open, and transparent" project that sets itself above the Chinese government, because we don't censor the truth here. Right? - <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/2001:558:1400:10:CCE7:9A6:F0E8:3725" title="Special:Contributions/2001:558:1400:10:CCE7:9A6:F0E8:3725">2001:558:1400:10:CCE7:9A6:F0E8:3725</a> (<a href="/w/index.php?title=User_talk:2001:558:1400:10:CCE7:9A6:F0E8:3725&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:2001:558:1400:10:CCE7:9A6:F0E8:3725 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 16:26, 18 April 2016 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Boy, that's a pretty silly stretch of the imagination, even for you, Mr. 2001. To be clear, my visit to China was to lobby the minister there to unblock Wikipedia and to further discussions to that end. I didn't on that trip do anything having to do with selling phone service to Chinese students coming to study in the United States. I'm not sure why you would link the two, nor what your point is meant to be. It is wrong to sell mobile phone service to Chinese students coming to study in the United States?--<a href="/wiki/User:Jimbo_Wales" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Jimbo_Wales#top" title="User talk:Jimbo Wales">talk</a>) 18:26, 18 April 2016 (UTC)

<dd>I believe when similar "stretches of imagination" regarding your affiliation with WikiBilim in Kazakhstan were mentioned to you, your initial response was to say that an "older encyclopedic work has been liberated by donating it into Wikipedia", to describe the systematic transfer of the autocratic state-approved encyclopedia into Kazakh Wikipedia. You then closed the discussion, saying it had "reached the point of the absurd". You said in a speech that you had spoken with the Prime Minister of Kazakhstan, which you then later expressly denied. Later, you did finally concede that if you knew in 2011 what you later came to find out about Rauan Kenzhekhanuly, you would not have selected him as your "Wikipedian of the Year". Apologies if your December 2015 trip to China included zero contact or confirmation with the "super recruiters" your firm is hiring in China. May we also assume that in your recent discussions with GreatFire (where Charlie Smith went from "loud-mouthed rhetoric" to "personal hero"), no part of that conversation discussed GreatFire's involvement or cooperation regarding anything related to The People's Operator or with the Jimmy Wales Foundation? - <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/2001:558:1400:10:FC:6F58:DB43:DB40" title="Special:Contributions/2001:558:1400:10:FC:6F58:DB43:DB40">2001:558:1400:10:FC:6F58:DB43:DB40</a> (<a href="/w/index.php?title=User_talk:2001:558:1400:10:FC:6F58:DB43:DB40&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:2001:558:1400:10:FC:6F58:DB43:DB40 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 19:15, 18 April 2016 (UTC)

<dd>You're just trolling on so many fronts here that it's not really worth responding. In the case of Kazakhstan, older encyclopedic work has been liberated by donating it into Wikipedia. I did misspeak once - I met with someone from the Prime Minister's office (to lobby them for change), but did not meet the Prime Minister himself. (I would do so, by the way, if the opportunity arose, again to lobby them for change.) No, there was no discussion with Charlie Smith about TPO. Yes, I met him with Orit Kopel of the Jimmy Wales Foundation, and we discussed ways that we might cooperate going forward. We had a frank discussion about our differences in the past, and resolved them satisfactorily. I fully expect to see future co-operation with GreatFire on issues in China. I also think they are unlikely to issue unfair claims about my views. This is how adults work together and move forward.--<a href="/wiki/User:Jimbo_Wales" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Jimbo_Wales#top" title="User talk:Jimbo Wales">talk</a>) 12:51, 19 April 2016 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for your response, Jimmy. That <i>was</i> some pretty intense trolling (or at least "trawling"), for which I apologize. Sometimes my "spidey senses" get the better of me, and I think that because there are two or three dots, they're worth trying to connect in some way. Lesson learned... I'll try to gather much more solid evidence before attempting any zingers. - <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/2001:558:1400:10:F9EC:3657:B897:C54C" title="Special:Contributions/2001:558:1400:10:F9EC:3657:B897:C54C">2001:558:1400:10:F9EC:3657:B897:C54C</a> (<a href="/w/index.php?title=User_talk:2001:558:1400:10:F9EC:3657:B897:C54C&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:2001:558:1400:10:F9EC:3657:B897:C54C (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 13:31, 19 April 2016 (UTC)</dd>
